The main causes of global warming are well-documented and widely accepted by the scientific community. According to various sources, including WWF-Australia and Global Warming 101, the top 10 causes of global warming include:\n\n1. Burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) for energy, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions.\n2. Deforestation and land-use changes, such as the clearing of forests for agriculture and urbanization.\n3. Methane emissions from agriculture, particularly from livestock farming.\n4. Industrial processes, such as cement production and steel manufacturing.\n5. Population growth and consumption patterns.\n\n**Scientific Consensus and Confidence**\n\nThe scientific consensus on global warming is clear: human activities are significantly contributing to the increase in global temperatures. According to the sources, scientists have known about the causes of global warming for decades, and the evidence is overwhelming. The confidence in the scientific findings is high, with a strong consensus among experts in the field. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has consistently reported that human-caused global warming is real and requires urgent attention.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nIn summary, the main causes of global warming are well-documented and widely accepted by the scientific community. The evidence is clear, and the confidence in the scientific findings is high. It is essential to address the root causes of global warming to mitigate its effects and prevent further climate change.",
